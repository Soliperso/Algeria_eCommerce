# Security Guidelines for Algeria E-commerce

## Environment Variables Security

### üîí **Critical Security Practices**

1. **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
   - The `.env` file contains sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and secrets
   - Always keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
   - Use `.env.example` as a template for team members

2. **Use strong, unique secrets**
   - JWT secrets should be at least 32 characters long
   - Use cryptographically secure random generators
   - Rotate secrets regularly in production

3. **Environment-specific configurations**
   - Use different API keys for development, staging, and production
   - Never use production keys in development
   - Use separate databases for each environment

### üìÅ **Files to Never Commit**

```
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.production
.env.staging
*.env
config/secrets.js
config/keys.js
secrets/
*.pem
*.key
*.crt
*.cert
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Production Security Checklist**

- [ ] All secrets are stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] Database credentials are encrypted
- [ ] API keys are environment-specific
- [ ] JWT secrets are strong and unique
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for all communications
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Input validation is in place
- [ ] SQL injection protection is enabled
- [ ] XSS protection is implemented

### üîë **Key Management**

1. **API Keys**
   - Store in environment variables
   - Use different keys for different environments
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Monitor key usage

2. **Database Credentials**
   - Use connection strings with encrypted passwords
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Use read-only credentials where possible
   - Regular backup and recovery testing

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Use sandbox keys for development
   - Implement webhook signature verification
   - Store minimal customer data
   - Comply with PCI DSS standards

### üåç **Algeria-Specific Considerations**

1. **Local Payment Gateways**
   - CIB (Credit Card Integration Bank)
   - SATIM (Algerian payment system)
   - Ensure compliance with local banking regulations

2. **Data Protection**
   - Comply with Algerian data protection laws
   - Store customer data within Algeria if required
   - Implement data encryption at rest and in transit

3. **Currency and Tax**
   - Use official DZD exchange rates
   - Implement proper tax calculations (19% TVA)
   - Maintain transaction records for audit purposes

### üö® **What to Do If Secrets Are Compromised**

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revoke compromised keys immediately
   - Generate new keys/secrets
   - Update all environments
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**
   - Check access logs
   - Identify scope of compromise
   - Document the incident

3. **Prevention**
   - Review access controls
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Update security procedures
   - Train team members

### üìù **Environment Variable Naming Conventions**

- Use `VITE_` prefix for client-side variables
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` not `DB`)
- Use UPPER_CASE with underscores
- Group related variables with prefixes

### üîß **Setup Instructions for Developers**

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file with your values
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Required Variables for Development**
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: API endpoint
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret

3. **Optional Variables**
   - Payment gateway keys (for testing payments)
   - Email service credentials (for notifications)
   - SMS service keys (for OTP)

### üìû **Contact for Security Issues**

If you discover a security vulnerability:
- Email: security@algeriacommerce.dz
- Do not create public GitHub issues for security problems
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure

## Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility! üîê
